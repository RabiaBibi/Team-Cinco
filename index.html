              <h1>Case Study A</h1>
               <h3>Why did you register to be a mentor on the Mentor 4U?</h3>
               I had a mentor which had helped me realise that I wasnâ€™t alone in sometimes feeling overwhelmed with the school work . He was also a great source in providing and assisting me to apply for university. The mentoring sessions were really valuable. I also wanted to develop the profile of my work when applying for work and University.

               <h3>How did participating in the Mentor 4U programme help you?</h3>
               After being a mentee, I applied to be a mentor on the programme and have since been allocated two of my very own mentees. This is a great opportunity for me to give something back to the programme, as well as disseminating the great advice that my mentor first gave to me!

               </p>

             <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-3">
               <h1>Case Study B</h1>
               <h3>Why did you register to be a mentor on the Mentor 4U?</h3>
               I had been involved in mentoring type activity previously and am a strong believer in the benefits of an effective mentoring relationship. Registering to Mento 4U allows me to give back to school that has supported me and also important for students to know they have someone that can relate.
               <h3>How did participating in the Mentor 4U programme help you?</h3>
               Being allocated a mentor via the Mentor 4U programme allowed me to access and benefit from the knowledge of someone with a wealth of shortlisting and interview experience. My mentor helped me to rebuild my confidence, refine my CV and improve the quality of my applications. I have absolutely no doubt that without the support from my Mentor 4U mentor, I would not have been able to make the move to my current role and I will be forever grateful for her support during this key transitional phase in my career.
